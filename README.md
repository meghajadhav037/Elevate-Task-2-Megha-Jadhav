Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset
# AI & ML Internship Project - Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## **Project Title:**  
Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## **Objective:**  
Perform in-depth EDA to understand the structure, relationships, and patterns in the Titanic dataset before building any Machine Learning model.

---

## **Dataset Used:**
- **Titanic Dataset** (Upload manually in Google Colab)
- Source: Kaggle / Public Dataset

---

## **Tools & Libraries:**
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Plotly  
- Google Colab

---

## **Key Exploratory Steps:**
1. **Data Upload & Basic Info**
2. **Handling Missing Values**
3. **Summary Statistics**
4. **Univariate Analysis** (Histograms, Boxplots)
5. **Bivariate Analysis** (Survival vs Gender, Class, Age)
6. **Correlation Matrix** (Only numeric features)
7. **Pairplots** for pattern visualization
8. **Skewness Detection**
9. **Multicollinearity Check**
10. **Key Insights**

---

## **Major Insights from EDA:**
- **Female passengers** had a significantly higher survival rate.
- **First-class** passengers had better survival chances than others.
- **Age and Fare** show skewness and outliers that may need transformation.
- **No strong multicollinearity** between core numeric features.
- EDA reveals important patterns that can guide feature selection for ML.

---

## **Instructions to Run:**
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**.
2. Run all cells step-by-step.
3. Upload the `titanic.csv` file when prompted.
4. EDA results and visualizations will be generated automatically.
